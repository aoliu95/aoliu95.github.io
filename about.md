Hi there! I’m Ao. I’m currently finishing my graduate study in Business Analytics at Carlson School of Management, U of M. I'm also actively looking for positions in data analytics and marketing analytics.
 
**A Light Data Lab** is the place I learn and try out fun things. And I really love this logo. :)
