description: My first #MakeoverMonday data project

I learned and gained the inspiration from my friend [Yu Dong](yudong-94.github.io/personal-website). Every week, [This website](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) would share a new social data and the article related to it, and would ask people to replicate the project in data visualization tools. I found it pretty interesting so I decided to give it a try this weekend!

I'll keep the post updated. :)
