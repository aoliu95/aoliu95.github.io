Data visulizaiton would always be fun if you have some interesting data. I learned and gained the inspiration from my friend [Yu Dong](yudong-94.github.io/personal-website). Every week, [This website](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) would share a new social data and the article related to it, and would ask people to replicate the project in data visualization tools. I found it pretty interesting so I decided to give it a try this weekend! Hope I can make it into a tradation for each week. :)

I also took reference from the [bump chart](http://www.sirvizalot.com/2016/03/color-popularity-for-new-cars-2000-2015.html) and [custom shapes](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/blog/2013/10/creating-and-utilizing-custom-shapes).

#### The Tableau Dashboard is [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/MoM329/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes) or you can see the embedded version below.
